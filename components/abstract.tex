This document will serve as an example to you, of how to use \LaTeX to write your
CSE Master's Thesis. It will have examples and recomendations, and hopefully a
few laughs.  Because this is the abstract, it will have to convince you that this 
template is something you want to use.  It has been proven, that without using
this template, writing your thesis will be much more dificult. The template is
based on previous work, and has been improved apon and updated.  The result of 
this template is a modern latex template that everyone can contribute to and use
for their studies of CSE @ TUM.
